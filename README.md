# retro-sockets
a simple tool for dispersed team retrospectives

### up and running
run `npm install` and `bower install`
open http://localhost:8080/ in your browser

### sockets are more fun with friends
want someone to join you, or maybe just see how it works with your phone?
just point other machines on the same network to your ip and port!

if you're on a mac, an easy way to find your ip is `system preferences > network` and just beneath the 'connected' label, you'll see your ip.
